                A settlement style that is generally characteristic of index options. Instead of stock changing hands

                investor
                must be recorded into the company's books as a shareholder to receive that dividend.
                Also included in the declaration is the “payable date,” which comes after the record date, and is the
                actual date dividend payments are made. Once these dates are established, the exchanges will then set
                the “ex-dividend” date (“ex-date”) for two business days prior to the record date. If you buy stock
                before the ex-dividend date, you will be eligible to receive the upcoming dividend payment.
                If you buy stock on the ex-date or afterwards, you will not receive the dividend.

            <h2>Lognormal Distribution</h2>
            <p>
                With respect to stock prices over a period of time, a lognormal distribution of daily price changes
                represents not the actual dollar amount of each change, but instead the logarithms of each change.
                Mathematically, this type of distribution implies that a stock's price can only range between 0 and
                infinity, which in the real world is the case. So in a sense a lognormal distribution could be
                considered to have a bullish bias. A stock can only drop 100% in value but can increase by more than
                100%. In general, assumptions made by option pricing models about a stock's future volatility are based
                on a lognormal distribution of future price changes.

        <div id="normal-distribution" class="box row">
            <h2>Normal Distribution</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most familiar mathematical distributions, it is a set of random observed numbers (or closing
                stock prices) whose distribution is symmetrical around the mean or average number. A graph of the
                distribution is the familiar “bell curve,” with the most frequently occurring numbers clustered around
                the mean, or the middle of the bell. Since this a symmetrical distribution, when the numbers represent
                daily stock price changes, for every possible change to the upside there must be an equal price change
                to the downside. The result is that a normal distribution would theoretically allow negative stock
                prices. Stock prices are unlimited to the upside, but in the real world a stock can only decline to
                zero. See “lognormal distribution.”
